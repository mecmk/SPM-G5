"""Business rules for story 19.1: raise an event change request, list them, withdraw one.

A change request records one field of an event in Planning, its value now, the value proposed
and why. Raising one changes nothing on the event, its bookings or its equipment holds (AC1/AC3):
the coordinator decides it later (stories 19.2-19.5).

Values are stored as canonical JSON text - keys sorted, moments in UTC - so the same value always
reads the same: a proposal identical to the current value is recognised and refused (AC4), and
story 19.2 can show both sides as they were when the request was raised.
