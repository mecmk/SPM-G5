"""Conflict-detection logic for venue bookings (story 14.2).

Story 14.2 - "As a Venue Staff member, I want the system to block approval of a conflicting
request so that a venue cannot be double-booked":

* AC1 approval is refused where the requested period overlaps a confirmed booking for the
  same venue;
* AC2 the refusal identifies the conflicting booking - ``BookingConflict`` carries the
  conflicting ``VenueBooking`` row;
* AC3 approving one of two overlapping pending requests refuses the other - this follows
  directly from AC1: once the first request is APPROVED, the second's held period now
  overlaps a confirmed booking and the same check refuses it.

Race safety: ``find_conflicting_booking`` / ``assert_no_conflict`` are a fast, friendly
pre-check only - they do not by themselves close the race between two concurrent approvals
(two overlapping requests could both pass the check before either commits). The database's
``ex_venue_bookings_no_double_booking`` exclusion constraint is the actual last word, so
``approve_booking`` attempts the write directly and translates that constraint's
``IntegrityError`` into ``BookingConflict``, mirroring ``app/venues/service.py::create_venue``'s
write-then-catch pattern.

Scope note: story 13.2 ("approve venue booking request", teammate Yu Bing) does not exist yet.
Once it does, its approve endpoint must call ``approve_booking`` (not just
``assert_no_conflict``) and translate ``BookingConflict`` into the HTTP response AC1/AC2 need.
